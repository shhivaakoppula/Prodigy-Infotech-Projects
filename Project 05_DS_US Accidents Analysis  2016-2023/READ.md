# Task-05 : Analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. Visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors.
# Description
This is a countrywide car accident dataset, which covers 49 states of the USA. This dataset has been collected in real-time, using multiple Traffic APIs and is collected from February 2016 to December 2020. Currently, there are about 1.5 million accident records in this dataset.
Apart from the US_Accident data set, I ahve also used a US population census dataset for each state and City, to verify the findings from Accident dataset with the population.

# Application of dataset
US-Accidents can be used for numerous applications such as real-time accident prediction, studying accident hotspot locations, casualty analysis and extracting cause and effect rules to predict accidents, or studying the impact of precipitation or other environmental stimuli on accident occurrence.
