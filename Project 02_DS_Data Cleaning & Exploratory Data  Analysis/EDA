# EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
1.Univariate Analysis
Summary Statistics: Calculate mean, median, mode, standard deviation, etc.
Visualizations: Use histograms, bar charts, and box plots to understand the distribution of individual variables.
2. Bivariate Analysis
Correlation Analysis: Use correlation matrices to understand relationships between variables.
Visualizations: Use scatter plots, pair plots, and heatmaps to visualize relationships.
3. Multivariate Analysis
Advanced Visualizations: Use techniques like pair plots, 3D scatter plots, and parallel coordinates plots to explore relationships between multiple variables.
4. Feature Engineering
Create New Features: Derive new features from existing ones to better capture the underlying patterns.
Transform Features: Apply transformations like scaling, normalization, or encoding categorical variables.
5. Outlier Detection
Identify Outliers: Use statistical methods and visualizations like box plots to detect outliers.
